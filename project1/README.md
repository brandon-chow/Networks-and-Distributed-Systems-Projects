Description:
My code uses multithreading to achieve bidirectional communication via UDP and TCP. To compile, simply run make, and the executable file "snc" will be created. If there's an error with input format, it will print "invalid input" accordingly. For other type of problems, it prints "internal error". And regarding Ctrl-D, in TCP, the program will terminate, and in UDP, the program (either server or client) will stop sending but remain able to recieve messages.
