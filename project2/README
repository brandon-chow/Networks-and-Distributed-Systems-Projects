My code can do both single thread download and parallel download using config file. The code is written in Python3 and if ./pftp.py, please do 'chmod u+x pftp.py' and then run.

Regarding the output, the program prints message to stder and return corresponding error message: 
1-can't connenct to server ; 2 - authentication faile; 3 - file not found; 
4-syntax error; 5 - command not implemented by server; 6- operatortion not allowed; 7 - generic error 

If -l is present, the program will write log to specified file or stdout.
